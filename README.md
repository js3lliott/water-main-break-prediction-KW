# Water Main Pipe Break/Failure Prediction ðŸš± ðŸš§

## What am I looking at?

Â Â Â This project was born out of cruising through the region of Kitchener-Waterloo (where I live) open source data and coming across a file of theirs containing the records of every water main break listed in the area, dating back to 1985. Me being the curious type, thought wouldn't it be cool if there was a way that this data could be used to predict which pipes were going to fail or are at risk of failure in the two cities, and city officials could use this data to attend to, and rehabilitate the infrastructure that is most at risk before anything more costly happens.
   
As a disclaimer, this project is subject to frequent iterations and edits as I read more research, and find new techniques or come up with new ideas for analysis.

Navigate to any notebook you want! The first few are data processing and feature engineering notebooks, feel free to skip those if you'd like. The ones that contain the meat of the project are the EDA notebook and the modeling notebook.
