# Water Main Pipe Break/Failure Prediction

   This project was born out of cruising through the region of Kitchener-Waterloo (where I live) open source data and coming across a file of theirs containing the records of every water main break listed in the area, dating back to 1985. Me being the curious type, thought wouldn't it be cool if there was a way that this data could be used to predict which pipes were going to fail or are at risk of failure in the two cities, and city officials could use this data to attend to, and rehabilitate the infrastructure that is most at risk before anything more costly happens.
   
   As a disclaimer, this project is subject to frequent iterations and edits as I read more research, and find new techniques or come up with new ideas for analysis.
