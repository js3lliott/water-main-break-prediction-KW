    "# Exploratory Data Analysis for Pipe Break Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "    Briefly introduce the project and the purpose of this EDA notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Set Up\n",
    "    Import all necessary libraries and modules. Set display options for notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Data Loading\n",
    "    Load the merged data from SQLite database into a pandas DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Initial Data Overview\n",
    "    - Print the shape of the DataFrame.\n",
    "    - Use the head() function to display the first few rows.\n",
    "    - Use the info() function to get an overview of the data types, non-null counts etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Data Cleaning\n",
    "    - Check for missing values and handle them appropriately (remove or impute).\n",
    "    - Check for duplicates and remove if any.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Feature Overview\n",
    "    - Describe each feature (column) briefly.\n",
    "    - Use describe() function to see summary statistics for numeric features.\n",
    "    \n",
    "## 7. Target Variable Analysis\n",
    "    - Analyze the target variable (probability of pipe breakage).\n",
    "    - Plot its distribution and comment on whether it's skewed, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. Categorical Variables Analysis\n",
    "    - For each categorical variable, use value_counts() to see the distribution.\n",
    "    - Use bar plots to visualize these distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9. Numerical Variables Analysis\n",
    "    - Use histograms or boxplots to visualize the distributions of numeric variables.\n",
    "    - Use scatterplots to see relationships between variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 10. Correlation Analysis\n",
    "    - Use a correlation matrix to understand the relationships between variables.\n",
    "    - Use a heatmap to visualize these correlations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 11. Feature Engineering Ideas\n",
    "    - Based on the above analysis, propose some ideas for creating new features that might be useful for prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 12. Conclusion\n",
    "    - Summarize your findings from this EDA.\n",
    "    - Describe the next steps for modeling."
